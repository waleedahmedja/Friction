# 🧠 Friction

**Friction** is a minimal focus-lock app built around one idea:

> If breaking focus is easy, focus never stands a chance.

Instead of just blocking apps or showing a timer, Friction introduces *deliberate resistance*.
You can exit early — but only if you’re willing to slow down, reflect, and make that choice consciously.

This app is not about punishment.
It’s about **intentional friction**.

## ✨ Philosophy

Most productivity tools optimize for speed.

Friction does the opposite.

* Slows impulsive exits
* Forces awareness before breaking focus
* Makes quitting *a decision*, not a reflex

The goal isn’t to trap the user.
The goal is to **interrupt autopilot**.

## 🎯 Core Ideas

* **Time Lock**
  Lock your session for a chosen duration.

* **Tap Challenge**
  Exiting early requires sustained, intentional interaction — no accidental escapes.

* **Reflective Messaging**
  Before returning home, the app pauses and asks you *why* you’re breaking the lock.

* **Minimal UI**
  No dopamine. No noise. Just space.

## 🧩 Design Principles

* Soft, rounded UI — calm, not harsh
* Centered layouts — visual balance over symmetry
* Delayed transitions — intentional pacing
* Subtle animations — feedback without distraction

Everything is designed to feel *considered*, not rushed.

## 🛠 Tech Stack

* Python
* Kivy / KivyMD
* Android (via Buildozer)

Built with simplicity and control in mind.

---

## 🚧 Status

Friction is an evolving experiment.

This repository represents:

* A working prototype
* Ongoing UI/UX iteration
* Continuous behavioral tuning

Feedback, forks, and thoughtful critique are welcome.

## 📌 Why “Friction”?

Because discipline doesn’t come from force.

It comes from **pauses**.

And sometimes, the smallest resistance changes everything.
