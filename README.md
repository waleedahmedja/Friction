# Friction

**Effort over enforcement.**

Friction is a lightweight, offline Android app that helps reduce screen time — not by force, but by effort.

It doesn’t block your phone.
It doesn’t lock you out.
It doesn’t fight your operating system.

Instead, it introduces *just enough resistance* to make you pause.

## Why Friction?

Most screen-time apps rely on control:
- Hard locks
- App blocking
- Heavy permissions
- Background services

They work… until the moment you really want to bypass them.

Friction works differently.

It assumes one thing:
> If you still want to exit, you should be able to —  
> but not without *feeling* the decision.

---

## How It Works

1. You choose a duration using a scroll-wheel time picker
2. Friction enters a full-screen focus mode
3. To exit early, you must complete a tap challenge
4. Reflective messages appear as you tap
5. The lock ends naturally when time completes

No tracking.  
No accounts.  
No internet.

Just friction.

## What Friction Is NOT

- ❌ Not a phone-locking app
- ❌ Not parental control
- ❌ Not a system-level blocker
- ❌ Not enforcement-based productivity

If the app is closed, the lock is gone — and that’s intentional.

---

## Philosophy

Friction doesn’t remove choice.

It slows impulse.

It’s designed to help you notice *why* you’re reaching for your phone — not punish you for it.

Discipline built this way tends to last longer.
